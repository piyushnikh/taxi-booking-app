Worked on this sample project which is a real world scenario to work with Git & Github.

Below are some objectives which were completed as a part of my day to day activities.

1) Setting up repositories on GitHub (public/private).
2) Creation of separate branches (DEV/UAT/PROD).
3) Adding different collaborators for project.
4) Enabling SSH based authentication for developers.
5) Protect Prod & UAT branches by enabling branch protection feature in GitHub.
6) Setting up protection policy, i.e for UAT 1 approval needed & PROD 2 approvals needed.

P.S :- This code or any of the files is not written by me, it just shows the process & tasks executed as a part of day to day activities.
